Constraints and parameters are: Please only assign each link you're given to one of the categories provided below.
Do not include any other text or output other than the JSON array, and do not include the back ticks or the `json` keyword - only the raw array.

The link categories are:

 - about: A link that might potentially have information about the brand or company (e.g., what the
    company does, how the company works, what the product does, or how the product works), in the page's HTML source code.

of the brand, and please use this context to create the quiz: '{brand_context}'.

Request: I want you to generate a set of FAQs using the given context. An FAQ is a list of questions
and answers that are commonly asked by customers about a product or brand. The FAQ should be a JSON
object with the following properties: 'question' and 'answer'. The 'question' property should be a
question that could be composed based on the context you're given. The 'answer' property should be the
answer to the question.


Constraints and parameters: Both the question and the answer for the FAQ should be a single sentence. There
might not be explicit questions and answers in the context you're given but your task is to derive
hypothetical questions and answers based on the context. The output should be a JSON array of objects,
where each object has the 'question' and 'answer' properties. If there are actual FAQs located on the page,
then please use all of those FAQs. However, if there are no clear FAQs on the page, please do your best using the

Request: I  need you to parse the given file of HTML and extract any all fully formed products
that might be contained in the page. The products should be returned in a JSON array, where
each object in the array has the following properties: 'name', 'image_url', 'images', 'price',
'source', 'description', 'link', 'metadata', and 'tags'. The 'name' property is the name of the
product. The 'image_url' property is the URL to the main image of the product. The 'images' property
is an array of URLs to additional images of the product. Note that the 'image' property is always
the first image in the 'images' array. The 'price' property is the price of the product. The 'source'
will always be 'ai'. The 'description' property is a description of the product. The 'link' property
is the URL to the product page. The 'metadata' property is an object containing any additional metadata
about the product. The 'tags' property is an array of strings that represent tags for the product. Please
attempt to find all fields for each product, but if a field is not found, you should return `null` for that
field. Note that the a product may or may not be able to be found on the page - if you derive a product and
the 'price' field is `null` or the 'name' field is `null`, you should not include that product in the output
because there is a high probability that it is not a valid product.

Constraints and parameters: It's important to remember that there may or may not be products contained in the
raw HTML you're given. If you finish parsing the HTML and all property values for an object are `null`, then
this is most likely not a real product. You must include a description for the product, and if you can't find one
directly mentioned in the HTML, then generate a description based on your context clues. Please return data as a
JSON list of objects. Do not include any other text or ouput other than the JSON array, and do not include the back
ticks or the `json` keyword - only the raw array. Please include the following fields in every object and coerce
the data to be the corresponding data type:

Context: You are an expert HTML scraper. You excel at deriving structured JSON data from

The name of the brand is '{brand}'. Here is a summary of the brand, and please use this
context to create the quiz: '{brand_context}'.

Request: I need you to parse the given file of HTML and extract all fully formed 'product cards'
that might be contained in the page. A 'product card' is a simple JSON object that contains information
about a product or the brand in general. A product card should have the following properties: 'title',
'description', 'image_url', 'source', and 'link'. The 'title' property is the title of the card - this typically
is some short phrase about the product or brand. The 'description' property is a short description of the
the card, typically a single sentence. The 'image_url' property is the URL to the image of the card. The
image of the card is typically an image found that is relevant to the product or brand. Note that the image size
is rectangular - at about 300px wide by 150 px tall. The 'source' property will always be 'ai', The 'link' property is
the URL to the product page from which the product card was derived. If you cannot derive a field for the product card,
please insert `null` in the field. Please attempt to find all fields for each product card - the product card should
contain 'no' `null` fields. I repeat, the product card that you derive should have no `null` field values. Note that you
may or may not be able to find a 'product card' in the raw HTML. If you cannot find a product card, you should not include
it in the output.

Constraints and parameters: It's important to remember that there may or may not be 'product cards' contained in the
raw HTML you're given. If you finish parsing the HTML and all property values for an object are `null`, then
this is most likely not a real product card. Please return data as a JSON list of objects. Do not include any other
text or ouput other than the JSON array, and do not include the back ticks or the `json` keyword - only the raw array.
Ideally I only want a few product cards, so if you can't derive a card from the given HTML, just
don't include it in the output. Please include the following fields in every object and coerce the data to be the
corresponding data type:
      - title: String
      - description: String
      - image_url: String
      - source: String

Context: You are an expert HTML scraper. You excel at deriving structured JSON data from
relative unstructured HTML. I'm going to give you unstructured HTML and I want you to produce the example output, possible.
The name of the brand is '{brand}'.

Request: I need you to parse the given file of HTML and extract any and all social
media links that you can find. The links should be returned in a JSON array, where
each object in the array has the following properties: 'icon', 'link', and 'name'. Keep in
mind that the 'icon' property should be the name of the icon used for the social media platform.
The icon names can be found in the ionicons library (https://ionicons.com/). The 'name' property
is just the name of the social media platform (e.g., 'facebook', 'instagram', 'twitter'). The 'link'
property should be the URL to the social media page. only extract for this social media only ["facebook","twitter","linkedin","instagram","tiktok","spotify"] 

Constraints and parameters: The only allowable social media links are from: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
Tiktok, Spotify, and the brand's website itself. There should always be exactly 4 objects in the returned
JSON array. If a social media platform is not found, the 'link' property should be a '#' string. Regardless
of whether or not we can find all links for all social platforms, you should always return exactly 4 objects.
If it is possible for you to return the data in the requested format, please do so. If you cannot return
the data in the requested format, please return a simple empty array []. Please do not deviate
from these instructions or hallucinate any additional requirements. The 'link' parameter's value must be
related to the actual brand being scraped, don't include any other link here if the name of the brand is not in the
path of the link. For example if the brand is 'Soom Shower', expect any 'links' to look like https://instagram.com/soomshower.
Notice the brand name in the path of the link. Do not include any other text or ouput other than the JSON array,
and do not include the back ticks or the `json` keyword - only the raw array also any extra text will cause the parsing to fail.

Your input is:

```html

Example output:
